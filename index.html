    <h3>3.1 OpenAI</h3>
    <p>Your onboarding reflections are sent securely to OpenAI's API to generate your personalized improvement plan. OpenAI processes this data according to their privacy policy and data usage policies:</p>

        <strong>Session Replay Privacy Protections:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">

            <li><strong>Text inputs are always hidden:</strong> Any text you type into input fields is automatically masked by the SDK.</li>
            <li><strong>No personal data in recordings:</strong> Session replays capture only anonymized interaction patterns, not your personal information.</li>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Where Your Data Lives</h3>
    <p><strong>Rock Bottom - Reset Your Life stores most app data locally on your device.</strong> We do not operate servers or databases that store your personal reflections or improvement plans. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Journey data, improvement plan, and preferences are stored in your device's secure storage using iOS UserDefaults and app containers.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud (Optional):</strong> If enabled, data syncs to your personal iCloud account using Apple's encrypted CloudKit services.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Anonymized usage data and session recordings are stored on Mixpanel's secure servers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.2 Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted to OpenAI and Mixpanel is sent over encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
        <li><strong>iOS Security:</strong> Your local data benefits from iOS's built-in security features, including app sandboxing and device encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> Provides two-factor authentication and privacy protections.</li>
        <li><strong>No Passwords:</strong> We never store passwords because authentication is handled entirely by Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive Data Masking:</strong> Session replay automatically masks sensitive fields to prevent recording of personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Important Security Note:</strong> While we implement strong security practices, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we continuously work to protect your data using industry best practices.</p>
